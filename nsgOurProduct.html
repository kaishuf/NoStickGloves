            <h4>Game Theory Project</h4>
            <h6>Prisoner's Dilema</h6>
            <p>Prisoner’s Dilemma is a game involving at least two teams. The idea is that prisoners are being separately questioned and are either gonna rat the other player out (betray), or lie and keep it a secret (collude).  For every round, each team must decide whether they will collude or betray. Both colluding will result in 0 points. You betraying while they collude means you gain 100 points. Them betraying but you colluding results in -500 points. And finally, both betraying results in -250 points. This game is played for a number of rounds and at the end, the team with the highest score wins. My partner and I investigated the code that was running the game and it shows that the scores are calculated at the end. Essentially what we did was change our history according to what our opponents had inputted before. Although we did not win, we did relatively well and our code was a success. Through this project, I learned more about interacting using GItHub as well as team skills like collaboration and patience.</p>

          <h4>Escape Room</h4>
          <h6>Escape from CATS-UH-WIZ</h6>
          <p>In this game, my partner and I created a Python escape room. This featured a series of puzzles and riddles eventually, and hopefully leading to the player’s escape. This project was fun as we got to use our creativity and essentially create anything we wanted within python’s capabilities. Because the code featured a series of different riddles and puzzles, both partners could code at the same time on the same document without interfering with each other. It is always helpful to work with a partner because they can help when you are stuck and both try to do better than the other which results in a better code overall at the end. Our code/game got a lot of good feedback from players in our class. If I were given a chance to develop the game further, I would add more levels and try to make the player even more immersed within the game.</p>
